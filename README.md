# Banking-Customer-Behavior-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction
## Abstract: 
It is very important for banks to predict the future financial needs and customer churn according to the customer's financial behavior, and the bank can provide reference and suggestions for the customer's future financial demand and customer churn according to the available information of data mining. In this context, from the perspective of banks, this paper establishes a customer churn prediction model based on the real customer financial behavior and churn data of banks, aiming to effectively identify potential churn customers of banks and provide data reference and suggestions for banks to prevent customer churn. Firstly, the original data was cleaned, mainly for the processing of missing values and duplicate values, and the missing values and duplicate values were processed from the aspects of data meaning and data quality, respectively. In terms of model prediction, different methods are used to cluster customers, and then XGBOOST, random forest and other methods are used to predict, different model results are evaluated and visualized, and the model with the best prediction performance is selected. This paper excavates the bank customer data and constructs an appropriate model to predict the churn of bank customers, which provides a suitable tool for banks to identify and retain lost customers in a timely manner.
